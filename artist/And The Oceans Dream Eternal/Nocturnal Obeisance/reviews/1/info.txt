Where to begin.

This album is quintessential Dungeon Synth. You hear it from the very first second of the roaring synths, followed by the soaring harpsichord, painting a world in shades of blue and grey. The artwork, perfectly capturing the familiar yet distant mystery of the album, like a dream in its otherworldly perfection. Although this album does keep a very uniform sound, and songs tend to sound the same from one to another, Thagurz is able to captivate the listener with the constantly shifting instruments and samples used from track to track. Keeping them extremely cohesive yet still providing some variety. That's not to say this album doesn't have some wonderful moments. There are some absolutely captivating sections that truly carry the album above another generic atmospheric dungeon synth album, to one that stands above the rest. Yet being on the longer side of albums, it may have benefited if a few tracks had been shortened and combined. The first of the two bonus tracks is the same as the rest of the album, but the second one is quite the ending. It takes the album to a much more grandiose sound, with pounding drums and a familiar but more warm synth tone transitioning into an ferocious ambient black metal track that wouldn't have felt far off of a Summoning album.

Overall, I would gladly recommend this album, especially for fans of Secret Stairways and Thangorodrim.
