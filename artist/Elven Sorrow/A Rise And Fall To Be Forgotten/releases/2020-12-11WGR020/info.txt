[Notes]
This is the debut album of Elven Sorrow. This release is based on the glory and misfortune of all those heroes lost in the tides of time, from where some shall arise but eventually everyone shall drown in the sea of perdition. The album reflects about those that have unrightfully drowned, whose deeds are worthy of numerous tales yet none has preserved until our times. While a separation into different tracks would seem logical, the album as a whole may also be viewed as a single song, henceforth being published as one.
