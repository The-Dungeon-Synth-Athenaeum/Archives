[Notes]
This short mini-album was originally part of a split cassette release circa 1995. Very few original copies were made, even fewer survive. White Wolf Productions has recently reissued a version of this EP in a limited edition cassette run. What is available here was digitized from the original master tape, as it was found (tape hiss and all).
