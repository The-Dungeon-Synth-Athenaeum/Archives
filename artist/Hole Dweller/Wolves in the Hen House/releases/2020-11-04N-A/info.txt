[Notes]
Immediately following where the story left off at the end of Returns to Roost, these songs picks up where the hobbits of Frogmorton, led by the now heroic Jamwine, band together to battle the goblins that have infested their bog, home, and hill.

The titular track "Wolves in the Hen House" serves to close the entire first era of Hole Dweller, as "Jamwine the Brave" opens the second era to fully debut in 2021.
