[Notes]
I was looking around at some old files and I got around to finding some of my very old works from when I first started. Here are four songs that I made before the 'Through Mountain and Forest' demo. The first two tracks are from my first two releases (which have been deleted from any of my pages on the internet). The final two tracks were originally going to be on a release that would have been entitled 'Journey to Middle-Earth', but I never released them. So with all that being said, I'm simply calling this 'Demo 2011'.
