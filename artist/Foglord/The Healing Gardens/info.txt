[Notes]
A few years back I was going through a time of panic and distress. One day I lied down to meditate, to find some inner peace and calmness.. It was then when a vision came to me. A vision of a beautiful place in which I descended a white stairway from what seemed to be a white void. At the foot of the stairs was an opening, a path with giant trees on each side. Birds were singing and there was a feeling of summer. I followed this path and came to a small bridge. Below was a pool of shimmering, clear water. On the other side I saw an altar and crossed over. There were flowers there around it, so colorful and lively. I looked upon the altar, which was made of stone, and there sat an orb of light, just like a star. I went up to this ball of energy and climbed into it. I felt as if I flew upwards, transported into space itself. It was very bright and the energy was flowing into me, warming, energizing and restoring me in a certain sense. I came back down, out of the orb, finding myself back at the altar. Feeling an intense tranquility, I went back the way I had came, over the bridge, through the forest and up the stairs. When I reached the top, I "awoke", I guess you could say. Still, at certain times, when I meditate or find myself feeling drained or down, I return there.. Into The Healing Gardens. There are many realms which we can access, those of inner strength, insight, beauty and wisdom.

This experience is the basis for this album.
