[Notes]
Life, in its seen and unseen aspects, is diverse yet connected. Magnificence and beauty are found in both the large and the small. Up and down, in and out, heart to heart, essence to essence, all things are reflecting back to one another.

Within life there is beauty. I feel that the beauty which we see on this earth goes deeper than the surface. The beauty that we see with our physical eyes and feel within is a reflection of a greater beauty deep inside of ourselves and in turn is a reflection of the Source. This beauty is felt and interpreted differently by everyone in an individual way and is found in both the simple and the complex. This essence is shared by all life and there is always within our awareness a part of ourselves that recognizes it. We just have to focus, see and feel.

This album is an individual expression of these pieces of beauty which I experience personally and how I interpret them. It is inspired by things of the past and things of the present, things of the soul and their reflection in the material realm. It is a mix of memories, imagination and an ever-present, wondrous view of life. It is an organic and earthy approach to deeper things.

My hope is that this album will bring a sense peace and beauty to all who listen and that you may go own your own journey.

All music by Darien D.

This album is dedicated to all of the beautiful people that I have met so far in this life and to all of the friends I have found in every corner of it, whether they may be people, plants or animals. It is also dedicated to the beauty that I see and feel all around me in its many forms and to those golden, luminous memories that I can never quite put into words.
